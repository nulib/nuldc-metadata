# nuldc-metadata-dump

This repository is a static metadata dump of Northwestern University Library's [Digital Collections site](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu). It dumps data from the Digital Collections API regularly. Use these collection-based datasets if you do not need the full-power of a dynamic search and IIIF-based responses. 

Data is broken out by format (serialization) and collection. Files are named by slugged-collection-name-[collectionID].
