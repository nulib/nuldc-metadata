Other family members on the trip included his wife, Caro, his son, Dana, and his daughter, Virginia. Also traveling with the Dawes family were Joseph E. Otis, John T. McCutcheon, Kenneth L. Roberts, and Ben Ames Williams. The large party was hosted by oil magnate Waite Phillips on his 150,000 acre ranch near Cimarron, New Mexico. Part One and Part Two depict Dawes and his party trout fishing in the Eagle Nest Lake, the Rayado Creek, and Box Canyon. Dawes and his family also are seen horseback riding in the trails of the Merino Valley. Charles Gates Dawes can be seen smoking his underslung pipe. Part Three depicts a cattle round-up. Ranchers are shown catching and branding cattle. Dawes and his family are later seen riding horses, visiting a grave, and leaving the Don Fernando Hotel. In the final section, Dawes visits the Puye Cliff Dwellings Pueblo north of Santa Fe, New Mexico. On that trip, the Taos Indians performed ceremonial dances for Dawes, New Mexico governor Richard Charles Dillon, lieutenant governor Edward Sargent, and Taos county representative Frank T.
