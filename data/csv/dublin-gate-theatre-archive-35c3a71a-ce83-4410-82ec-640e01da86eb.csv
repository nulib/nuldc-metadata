The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Dublin Gate Theatre|Theater|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Theater|Ireland--Dublin|England--London",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Theater|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Theater|Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Ireland--Dublin|Egypt",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Dublin Gate Theatre|Theater|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Theater|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Theater|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

Theatre under Edwards and MacLiammóir held in the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections consist of 384 boxes, 7 large art folders of drawings, and 69 original press cuttings books. The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Theater|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Theater|Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Illinois--Woodstock|Welles, Orson, 1915-1985|Dublin Gate Theatre|Theater|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Theater|Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Theater|Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Dublin Gate Theatre|Theater|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Theater|Ireland--Dublin|Egypt",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Theater|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play.

Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Theater|Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing.

The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Theater|Ireland--Dublin|Wilde, Oscar, 1854-1900",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Theater|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

Theatre under Edwards and MacLiammóir held in the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections consist of 384 boxes, 7 large art folders of drawings, and 69 original press cuttings books. The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Theater|Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

Theatre under Edwards and MacLiammóir held in the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections consist of 384 boxes, 7 large art folders of drawings, and 69 original press cuttings books. The production scripts and notebooks, arranged by play title, account for 316 of these boxes, the music 17, photographs 5, lighting plots 3, plans 1. The costume, scenery and miscellaneous designs by MacLiammóir and others are in 7 oversize folders. The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection. The plays are arranged alphabetically by title and consist of annotated scripts, prompt and production copies, and the production notebooks of Hilton Edwards who produced and directed every play. The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Theater|Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Ireland--Dublin",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.

The theatre correspondence and that of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir from 1938 to 1970 are filed in 29 boxes; the manuscripts of Hilton Edwards are in 2 boxes and those of Micheál MacLiammóir in 10 boxes. The separation of the various components of a production reflects the order in which the Gate itself held them. Productions: The 316 boxes of production materials comprise the major portion of the collection.

The inventory lists all holdings for each play as well as dates of any known productions or revivals between 1928 and 1977. Music: The music used by the Gate for productions form 1928-1970 is held in 17 boxes, arranged alphabetically by title of the production or composer. Photographs: The production and publicity photographs are in 15 boxes, listed alphabetically by production title. The photographs are not all identified nor present for all productions. The dates of these run from 1928-1970 only. Lighting Plots: The original lighting plots are arranged alphabetically in 3 boxes as held by the Gate. Though unsigned, they are nearly all by Hilton Edwards. Design-Plan Books, Time Books: One box contains set designs, lists of scenery and ground plans for a limited number of Gate productions, largely undated. The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings.

The notebook numbers are those used by the Gate. Set designs and ground plans which were loose have been placed in the production boxes where possible. Costume and Miscellaneous Sketches: This group of diverse pencil and watercolor or tempera designs, mainly done by Micheál MacLiammóir between 1928 and 1977, has been arranged and described as clearly as possible. The sketches have been identified by production, author, and title where possible, with the size and medium noted. Correspondence: The correspondence in the papers is in 29 boxes and has been divided into “general” theatre and business correspondence of 1938-1950 (1 box), 1953-1960 (9 boxes), 1961-1970 (4 boxes); Hilton Edwards’ correspondence of 1953-1970 (5 boxes); and Micheál MacLiammóir’s correspondence of 1952-1970 (9 boxes). It should be noted that the correspondence is arranged chronologically, and that the years covered, except for one early box, are only the years 1952 to 1970. Manuscripts: Those of Hilton Edwards, contained in two boxes, include drafts and proofs of his two published books, The Mantle of Harlequin and Elephant in Flight, and many identified articles. The second box contains his articles and scripts of others during his position with Radio Éireann, 1961-1963. The manuscripts of Micheál MacLiammóir are held in 10 boxes, and are listed alphabetically by book or play title. His shorter “writings” are listed alphabetically as such, and dated where given. Correspondence on the “writings” is included here. Press Cuttings: The press cuttings books nos. 1, 3-10, 12-66, are those of the Gate and numbered as held by them. Books 2 and 11 are missing. The inclusive dates are 2/10/1928 to 6/2/1971. Much valuable information can be gleaned from the fragile clippings. Miscellany: The papers include two boxes of interesting miscellany about the past and present Gate Theatre.","Dublin Gate Theatre Archive, 1928 - 1979",,Done,,"Dublin Gate Theatre|Edwards, Hilton, 1903-1982|Mac Liammóir, Micheál, 1899-1978|Theater|Ireland--Dublin|Ireland--Cork",,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.
