"Manasseh Cutler (1742-1823) was ordained as a minister of the Congregational society, later serving as a chaplain in the Continental army. Cutler also studied medicine and had a fascination for botanical study and astronomy, publishing papers and being elected to the American Academy. In 1787 he was elected a director of the Ohio Company, formed with a view to settling the Northwest Territory by a group of Revolutionary officers who wanted to receive their ""bounty lands"" in that area. After the work of drawing up the agreements and surveying the Northwest Territory, Cutler returned to Massachusetts where he served in the House and was also elected from that state as a member to the 7th and 8th Congresses of the United States.  The Manasseh Cutler Collection contains 80 bound volumes of documents and correspondence written by Cutler or sent to him from 1762-1820 which reflect all aspects of his life and career. Contained in it are his journals (1765-1783), sermons (1768-1820), scientific observations, correspondence, Cutler family genealogy, and agreements and observations about the Ohio Company and the settlement of the Northwest Territory. His descendants supplied some documents extending to 1849 regarding the settlement of Ohio. The Collection was donated by his descendant, Evanston resident Charles G. Dawes, in 1942.

"Manasseh Cutler (1742-1823) was ordained as a minister of the Congregational society, later serving as a chaplain in the Continental army. Cutler also studied medicine and had a fascination for botanical study and astronomy, publishing papers and being elected to the American Academy. In 1787 he was elected a director of the Ohio Company, formed with a view to settling the Northwest Territory by a group of Revolutionary officers who wanted to receive their ""bounty lands"" in that area. After the work of drawing up the agreements and surveying the Northwest Territory, Cutler returned to Massachusetts where he served in the House and was also elected from that state as a member to the 7th and 8th Congresses of the United States.

"Manasseh Cutler (1742-1823) was ordained as a minister of the Congregational society, later serving as a chaplain in the Continental army. Cutler also studied medicine and had a fascination for botanical study and astronomy, publishing papers and being elected to the American Academy. In 1787 he was elected a director of the Ohio Company, formed with a view to settling the Northwest Territory by a group of Revolutionary officers who wanted to receive their ""bounty lands"" in that area. After the work of drawing up the agreements and surveying the Northwest Territory, Cutler returned to Massachusetts where he served in the House and was also elected from that state as a member to the 7th and 8th Congresses of the United States.  The Manasseh Cutler Collection contains 80 bound volumes of documents and correspondence written by Cutler or sent to him from 1762-1820 which reflect all aspects of his life and career. Contained in it are his journals (1765-1783), sermons (1768-1820), scientific observations, correspondence, Cutler family genealogy, and agreements and observations about the Ohio Company and the settlement of the Northwest Territory. His descendants supplied some documents extending to 1849 regarding the settlement of Ohio. The Collection was donated by his descendant, Evanston resident Charles G. Dawes, in 1942.

"Manasseh Cutler (1742-1823) was ordained as a minister of the Congregational society, later serving as a chaplain in the Continental army. Cutler also studied medicine and had a fascination for botanical study and astronomy, publishing papers and being elected to the American Academy. In 1787 he was elected a director of the Ohio Company, formed with a view to settling the Northwest Territory by a group of Revolutionary officers who wanted to receive their ""bounty lands"" in that area.

"Manasseh Cutler (1742-1823) was ordained as a minister of the Congregational society, later serving as a chaplain in the Continental army. Cutler also studied medicine and had a fascination for botanical study and astronomy, publishing papers and being elected to the American Academy. In 1787 he was elected a director of the Ohio Company, formed with a view to settling the Northwest Territory by a group of Revolutionary officers who wanted to receive their ""bounty lands"" in that area. After the work of drawing up the agreements and surveying the Northwest Territory, Cutler returned to Massachusetts where he served in the House and was also elected from that state as a member to the 7th and 8th Congresses of the United States.  The Manasseh Cutler Collection contains 80 bound volumes of documents and correspondence written by Cutler or sent to him from 1762-1820 which reflect all aspects of his life and career. Contained in it are his journals (1765-1783), sermons (1768-1820), scientific observations, correspondence, Cutler family genealogy, and agreements and observations about the Ohio Company and the settlement of the Northwest Territory. His descendants supplied some documents extending to 1849 regarding the settlement of Ohio. The Collection was donated by his descendant, Evanston resident Charles G. Dawes, in 1942.

"Manasseh Cutler (1742-1823) was ordained as a minister of the Congregational society, later serving as a chaplain in the Continental army. Cutler also studied medicine and had a fascination for botanical study and astronomy, publishing papers and being elected to the American Academy. In 1787 he was elected a director of the Ohio Company, formed with a view to settling the Northwest Territory by a group of Revolutionary officers who wanted to receive their ""bounty lands"" in that area. After the work of drawing up the agreements and surveying the Northwest Territory, Cutler returned to Massachusetts where he served in the House and was also elected from that state as a member to the 7th and 8th Congresses of the United States.  The Manasseh Cutler Collection contains 80 bound volumes of documents and correspondence written by Cutler or sent to him from 1762-1820 which reflect all aspects of his life and career. Contained in it are his journals (1765-1783), sermons (1768-1820), scientific observations, correspondence, Cutler family genealogy, and agreements and observations about the Ohio Company and the settlement of the Northwest Territory.

"Manasseh Cutler (1742-1823) was ordained as a minister of the Congregational society, later serving as a chaplain in the Continental army. Cutler also studied medicine and had a fascination for botanical study and astronomy, publishing papers and being elected to the American Academy. In 1787 he was elected a director of the Ohio Company, formed with a view to settling the Northwest Territory by a group of Revolutionary officers who wanted to receive their ""bounty lands"" in that area. After the work of drawing up the agreements and surveying the Northwest Territory, Cutler returned to Massachusetts where he served in the House and was also elected from that state as a member to the 7th and 8th Congresses of the United States.  The Manasseh Cutler Collection contains 80 bound volumes of documents and correspondence written by Cutler or sent to him from 1762-1820 which reflect all aspects of his life and career. Contained in it are his journals (1765-1783), sermons (1768-1820), scientific observations, correspondence, Cutler family genealogy, and agreements and observations about the Ohio Company and the settlement of the Northwest Territory. His descendants supplied some documents extending to 1849 regarding the settlement of Ohio. The Collection was donated by his descendant, Evanston resident Charles G. Dawes, in 1942. This collection contains over 10,000 items, letters, diaries and journals.",P0330_Cutler_v07,,https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/fdc40984-9bb2-4a78-94d6-767e6af851ef,Work,ark:/81985/n2s75931c,34683c83-505f-4b35-8ea3-536cb2fe3c2d|5d0e72b4-9e1e-42ed-a922-67caf617ce8d|9c819e6b-1365-4fc8-8938-a3b88b992ef2|a38b639b-e42b-4c70-ac07-86ce4e2cc893|fc0bbb7c-a63f-41e2-a999-c687c0b05911,,,https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/fdc40984-9bb2-4a78-94d6-767e6af851ef,,,"Manasseh Cutler Collection, 1762-1820","Cutler, Manasseh, 1742-1823",2021-11-30T21:51:25.856433Z,,ab24e0ec-8a9c-4c7e-a994-ebcdf0da2cd1,,1787,,"front cover|inside front cover|flyleaf, recto|flyleaf, verso|flyleaf, recto|flyleaf, verso|flyleaf, recto|flyleaf, verso|flyleaf, recto|flyleaf, verso|flyleaf, recto|flyleaf, verso|journal cover|inside journal front cover|page 1 recto.
