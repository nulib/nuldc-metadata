Lefley continues his discussion on the importance of the writer’s craft and technique with a thorough examination of characterization, sensory impressions, narrative pace, point of view, and methods of introspection. Next, English critic and philosopher Sir Herbert Read gives a talk entitled “The Depths Within” about the art of fiction. In the final portion of the program, selections that explore the writer’s vision of life from Anton Chekov, William Faulkner, Thomas Mann, and James Joyce are read. Passages from letters Chekov wrote about the role of the artist are read by Professor Jacob Scher of Northwestern University. Then James Joyce reads the excerpt from his “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man” which has come to be considered the credo of the artist as rebel.

Lefley describes the program as an attempt “to bring Joyce the man, rather than the legend, into the open, to see close-up what he was like, and to indicate something of what he was trying to do in his art.” Lefley begins by providing a brief biographical background of Joyce. The first portion of the program is a recording of a meeting of the James Joyce Society in New York City. Dr. Delmore Schwartz, poet and editor of the Irish Review, presents his views on Joyce. Irish poet Padraic Colum is an audience member who contributes to the discussion. Next, the first pages from each of Joyce’s large prose works including “Dubliners,” “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,” “Ulysses,” and “Finnegans Wake” are read to indicate the progression of his writing style.

The program features a recording from the New School for Social Research’s literary banquet held in New York City. The main topic of the event was the life and role of the young writer. The main speakers at the banquet were novelists John Burress, James T. Farrell, Millen Brand, and philosopher/psychologist Horace M. Kallen. Essays by Katherine Anne Porter and Pearl Buck that focus on how talent develops are read by Lefley. Before each talk is presented, Lefley provides a brief biography of each speaker. Lefley begins the program by sharing some background about the New School for Social Research and the growth of writer’s workshop. Lefley gives the reading of Katherine Anne Porter’s essay, “No Masters or Teachers.” The first speaker at the banquet is author John Burress who speaks about the difficulty he had getting his first novel, “Little Mule” published. Chicago author James T. Farrell speaks next about the struggles of a young writer. Millen Brand then discusses the importance of the editing and revision process and his own thoughts on writing from the unconscious. The program concludes with an essay and a talk that discuss creative energy and what it demands of the writer. Lefley reads an essay written by Pearl Buck entitled “Creative Energy Pushes Us From Within.” The final talk at the literary banquet is given by Horace M. Kallen and he discusses the role of the writer. Part One is Lefley’s introduction through James T. Farrell’s talk. Part Two begins with Brand’s talk and concludes with Horace M. Kallen’s talk.

Lefley describes it as being both a prospectus and manifesto. In the introduction to the program, Lefley explains that the Fiction Review will be devoted to short story readings, interviews with authors of serious fiction, and readings from authors and critics on the art of fiction writing. Lefley then previews some upcoming episodes including interviews with seven young American novelists. For the manifesto section of the program, Lefley discusses the basis on which short stories will be selected or what Lefley refers to as “the Art of Fiction.” Finally, excerpts from four of the world’s great modern writers: Anton Chekov, William Faulkner, Thomas Mann, and James Joyce are presented. Part One is the original opening of The Fiction Review from 1954. The readings from Mann, Joyce, Faulkner, and Chekov are not included. Part Two is the rebroadcast of Fiction Review #1 from May 16, 1961 and has been slightly revised. Part Two includes readings by Chekov on the life of the artist. Then James Joyce reads the excerpt from “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man” which has come to be considered the credo of the artist as rebel. Two portions of Thomas Mann’s novel “Tonio Kröger” are read. The beginning of the novel is read by Mann in German and the conclusion of the novel is read in English by Professor Jacob Scher of Northwestern University. Scher also reads the address that William Faulkner gave when he received the National Book Award for “A Fable.” Lefley concludes the program by presenting a reading by Faulkner of his own Nobel Prize acceptance speech.",Part One|Part Two|Part One|Part Two|5t34sm44f/bv73c2129.mods.xml|Part One technical metadata file|Part Two technical metadata file|Part One asset back|Part One asset front|Part Two asset back|Part Two asset front,,,open reel audiotapes,a74b2f51-7f16-4fdf-a033-e8c6a82393cb,,https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/a74b2f51-7f16-4fdf-a033-e8c6a82393cb?as=iiif,2023-02-20T16:32:47.805784,AVR Migration,avr_migration.csv,,English,bv73c2129,University Archives,None,,2022-12-19T18:34:47.192285Z,,1/4 inch open reel tape,,Level 1,"{'cycle': '2018', 'desc': 'Bob Lefley is one of the founders of WFMT.
