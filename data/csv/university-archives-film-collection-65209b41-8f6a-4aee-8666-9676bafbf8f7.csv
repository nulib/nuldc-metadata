The first part is a NBC news report about the demolition and plans for the future. The second part is silent footage of the demolition. Plans for the construction of Nathaniel Leverone Hall are shown. Northwestern president J. Roscoe Miller and others are present at the demolition.  Northwestern University announced plans to build Nathaniel Leverone Hall as a new building for the School of Business/Commerce. When the School of Business began planning for its new building, it had occupied Memorial Hall (the “Little Red Schoolhouse”) since 1937. In the late 1960s, Dean John A. Barr decided to gradually discontinue the University’s undergraduate program in business education and transform the School of Business into a graduate school specializing in management education. His plans also included consolidation of the school’s program for full-time students in a new building on the Evanston campus. After the last students in the undergraduate program of the School of Business graduated in June of 1970, Memorial Hall was torn down. Groundbreaking for Leverone Hall took place July 8, 1970.  In 2001, the entire complex of buildings was renamed the Donald P. Jacobs Center in honor of the longtime dean of the Kellogg School of Management, successor to the School of Business.",News report on the demolition of Memorial Hall|Footage of demolition|News report on the demolition of Memorial Hall|Footage of demolition|x633f261f/xs55md46x.mods.xml|News report on the demolition of Memorial Hall technical metadata file|Footage of demolition technical metadata file|News report on the demolition of Memorial Hall asset front|Footage of demolition asset front,,,,10a48366-8070-45bc-9068-65e1f1b410d4,,https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/10a48366-8070-45bc-9068-65e1f1b410d4?as=iiif,2023-02-20T16:33:28.933096,AVR Migration,avr_migration.csv,,English,xs55md46x,University Archives,None,,2022-02-18T13:32:03.865655Z,,,,Level 1,"{'cycle': '2018', 'desc': None, 'manager': 'Dan Zellner', 'name': 'School of Commerce Building Films', 'proposer': 'Kevin Leonard', 'task_number': 'J0105'}",,True,"WMAQ-TV (Television station : Chicago, Ill.)",,Related Information,https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/posters/62464db4-ea07-4ee0-82a6-987adc9be9d7,,In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted,,,,Done,,"Northwestern University (Evanston, Ill.)|Northwestern University (Evanston, Ill.).
