Ogletree was one of more than 100 African American student activists who occupied the Bursar’s Office for 38 hours to protest the state of Black student’s experiences at Northwestern. Kathryn Ogletree was a leader in the Bursar's Office Takeover and served as the president of FMO (For Members Only). She was instrumental in advocating for African American student’s demands to Northwestern University’s administration. The Bursar's Office Takeover ended with the “May 4th Agreement,” a negotiated solution that promised increased black student enrollment, financial aid and black history and culture studies and the establishment of the Black House.  In March 2018, Ogletree was invited back to campus as part of the Women’s Center’s 30th anniversary and the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of 1968 Bursar’s Office Takeover.  She discussed the role of women in student activism for an audience of about 50 at Harris Hall. The director of Northwestern University Women's Center, Dr. Sekile Nzinga Johnson, PhD, MSW introduces the program and provides a brief history of Northwestern's Women's Center. Charla Wilson, Archivist for the Black Experience at Northwestern University Libraries, speaks about the context and significance of having Kathryn Ogletree speak about the takeover from her perspective. Graduate student, Tay Glover, provides a brief biography and introduction of Kathryn Ogletree.

As an organization, FMO and AASU members voted to recuse athletes from occupying the building because they had the most to lose if their athletic scholarships were revoked. Some of those athletes are pictured here. The woman to the right holding the sign is Laura Murray. The sign states, ""Black students occupy this building because the administration has turned a deaf ear.""

Other photos feature James Turner, President of African American Student Union (AASU), and a lead negotiator in the Bursar's Office Takeover holding the list of demands drafted by FMO and AASU and presented to Northwestern administration on April 22, 1968 and speaking with the press. This photo is taken in front of the Bursar's Office on 619 Clark Street in Evanston, IL. Northwestern University student, Stephen Broussard is also pictured with Turner. 

There are photos of a crowd consisting of students, Northwestern staff, and the press gathers in front of the Bursar's Office as approximately 120 Black Northwestern University students occupy the building as a means to compel the campus administration to address discriminatory campus policies and to heighten awareness of Black students' experiences of alienation at Northwestern University.",Recto|Verso,Photographs,4,contact sheets,a6d5305a-dbdd-4659-a1a6-b78ad2a3e1b1,Series 31/6/155,https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/a6d5305a-dbdd-4659-a1a6-b78ad2a3e1b1?as=iiif,2023-02-20T16:12:20.538271,None,None,,,inu:dil-1a7a7b88-7b39-4d5e-b237-06c43316a067|inu:dil-54533d95-f58b-4336-b276-4e432cc407d6,University Archives,None,,2022-08-30T19:43:34.061834Z,,1 photograph,28 cm (height) x 22 cm (width),Level 1,"{'cycle': None, 'desc': None, 'manager': None, 'name': None, 'proposer': 'Charla Wilson', 'task_number': 'Job:J0097'}",,True,,,,https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/855307c7-a748-41d9-b701-6fa59d5f1794,,In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted,,,,Done,,"Illinois--Evanston|Civil rights demonstrations|Student movements|Northwestern University (Evanston, Ill.).
