"""Every year Mrs. Lydia L. Pederson spends her vacation seeing as much as possible of the world as quickly as possible. She is a partner in a large metal foundry in Rockford, Illinois and recently spent two days in Cape Town. At present Mrs. Pederson is on a vacation tour of two months which will take her through South Africa to the Victoria Falls, Tanganyika, Kenya, Egypt and Palestine and which will cost her $10,000. She travels only by air and by car. 'I am in too great a hurry and too restless to travel any other way - my vacation is too short, and there is yet so much more that I wish to see.' This is how she expressed herself last evening to the Burger, after having completed a whole day tour of Cape Town and the vicinity. She spends at the most a few days in a country, and the twenty days which she is spending in South Africa will be the longest that she has ever devoted to touring in one country.
