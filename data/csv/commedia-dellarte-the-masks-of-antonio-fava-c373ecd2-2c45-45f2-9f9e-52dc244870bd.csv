Beyond being a great comic protagonist ever since his origin in the early seventeenth century, he is also the most important reference point for observing and understanding the historical survival of improvised comedy. While Commedia dell'Arte as an economic structure suddenly disappears after, or because of, the French Revolution, a victim of the people's hatred of the king and his minions, and therefore against the mask theatre so prized at the French court, Pulcinella holds on in Naples and other parts of the south, especially Calabria. He prevails precisely because he begins to argue political topics; he sides with the winners. But if Pulcinella ends badly in one sense, he triumphs in another. He enters as the only mask/character in the new bourgeois comedy of the nineteenth century and keeps himself warm in that new setting, giving up his great passions of the past - except in exceptional cases, such as that of Antonio Petito - to become a marginal figure who tosses in occasional witty observations from the side of the stage. This great character, however, finds his outlet in popular festivals. In Calabria, the tradition of Pulcinella is decidedly freer and more articulated. Every festival has its Pulcinella, who acts as a solo actor, narrator, storyteller, entertainer, acrobat, magician, juggler, as well as functioning as a sort of overall director of the festival. Today, Pulcinella has perhaps too much history to be able to be described in a single way. Like Pirandello's famous character, he is one, nobody, and a hundred thousand. Whoever he may be, he is always the comic symbol of urgency of survival pure and simple.

He goes into exaltation, becomes deeply moved, and slobbers over himself while describing the recipe, for instance, of real lasagna. He is scandalized, indignant, and furious when reporting barbarous variations and ignoble practices.

But besides this extremely human defect, the Magnifico represents the highest authority in the family. He is the one who is in charge of not only the economy and finances, but also the destiny of the household and all who live there. He decides whether or not to pay the servants (he generally inclines against it, not without good reason), and he decides where his son or daughter (the Lovers) will marry, when, and whom. He thus sets in play the great drama of the Lovers, whose solution becomes material for the three traditional acts of the comedy. ""Magnifico"" is therefore the technical term that indicates the character. His given name is determined by dialect and geography: Pantalone if he is Venetian; Stefanel Botarga if Milanese; Zanobio da Piombino if Tuscan; Biscegliese if from Puglia; and he can be ""Pep"" and something more if we make him Catalan, or a ""Mc"" and something more if we make him Scottish, and so on, without any change in his character, behavior, or function. The most famous and historically most common Magnifico is the Venetian one, Pantalone. The name is probably a contraction of pianta il leone, he who plants the lion, the symbol of the Venetian republic. Venetian merchants ""planted the lion"" in southern and Mediterranean markets. They conquered the world by opening plants and dominating local economies. Our Pantalone, therefore, is a Venetian merchant, a perfect example of the shrewd, cunning, vulgar, and proud dynamism of the refined, opulent, and marvelous city-state.",Front|Left|Right,,,comic masks,7298fdce-adc1-4501-9e14-9e8bd985e149,,https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/7298fdce-adc1-4501-9e14-9e8bd985e149?as=iiif,2023-02-20T16:04:28.686298,None,None,,,,Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections,None,Reggio Emilia,2021-06-10T16:43:09.761465Z,,"1 mask : grey leather, elastic, fiber",18 x 15 x 16 cm,Level 1,"{'cycle': '2018', 'desc': ""A collection of commedia dell'arte masks created by Commedia dell'Arte expert and Northwestern University Press author Antonio Fava.
