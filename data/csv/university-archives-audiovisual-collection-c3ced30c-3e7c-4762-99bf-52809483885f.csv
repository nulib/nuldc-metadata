Powers, a friend and political aide of John F. Kennedy, at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Vanocur conducted a series of interviews with Powers in 1964 for the book, ""Johnny We Hardly Knew Ye."" Vanocur was originally involved in this project, along with David Powers, Kenneth O'Donnell and Lawrence O'Brien. After a period of time, however, the book project was stopped. Later, Powers and O'Donnell decided to begin the project again, this time with the help of Joe McCarthy; on this second start Vanocur and O'Brien were not directly involved although Vanocur gave the interviews to Powers and O'Donnell. The interviews between Vanocur and Powers, however, proved to be the backbone of material for much of the book. This program begins with Vanocur describing taped footage of Jacqueline Kennedyâ€™s appearances during the day which include her arrival at the airport and her remarks at a reception for the delegates. Powers then discusses the legacy and life of John F. Kennedy with Vanocur. In 1946, John F. Kennedy asked Powers to join his congressional campaign. Powers agreed and continued to work with John F. Kennedy on all of his subsequent campaigns, including the 1960 campaign for President. After Kennedy was elected, Powers served as Special Assistant to the President from 1961 to 1963. In 1964, he became the first curator of the John F. Kennedy Library, a position he held until 1994. Vanocur served as White House correspondent and national political correspondent for NBC News in the 1960s and early 1970s. He was one of the questioners at the first Kennedy-Nixon debate in 1960 and was also chosen as one of the questioners in the 1992 presidential debate.",j0123-sander_vanocur.wav|6d56zw66p/1831cm557.mods.xml,,,open reel audiotapes,90c9c805-470a-4a69-ad85-f2a922053e11,,https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/90c9c805-470a-4a69-ad85-f2a922053e11?as=iiif,2023-02-20T16:31:28.874335,AVR Migration,avr_migration.csv,,English,1831cm557,University Archives,None,,2022-02-17T22:43:16.150560Z,,,,Level 1,"{'cycle': None, 'desc': None, 'manager': None, 'name': None, 'proposer': None, 'task_number': None}",,True,,,,https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002,,In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted,,,,Done,,"Politics and government|Kennedy family|Kennedy, John F.
