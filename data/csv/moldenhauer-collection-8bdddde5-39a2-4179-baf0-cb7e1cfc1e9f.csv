Other prominent composers and musicians represented in the Northwestern holdings include: John Blow (1648/9-1708), Benjamin Britten (1913-1976), Gustave Charpentier (1860-1956), Vincent d’Indy (1851-1931), Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848), Edward Elgar (1857-1934), Charles Gounoud (1818-1893), Bohuslav Martinů (1890-1959), Anton Rubenstein (1829-1894), Camille Saint-Säens (1835-1921), and Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958).

Manuscripts by Ernest Bloch (1880-1959), Max Bruch (1838-1920), Max Keller (1770-1855) Ferdinand Praeger (1815-1891), a substantial collection of letters by Jules Massenet (1842-1912), and a sketch by Gustav Mahler (1860-1911) are among some of the most notable items. Other prominent composers and musicians represented in the Northwestern holdings include: John Blow (1648/9-1708), Benjamin Britten (1913-1976), Gustave Charpentier (1860-1956), Vincent d’Indy (1851-1931), Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848), Edward Elgar (1857-1934), Charles Gounoud (1818-1893), Bohuslav Martinů (1890-1959), Anton Rubenstein (1829-1894), Camille Saint-Säens (1835-1921), and Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958). Additionally, a significant number of late 19th and early 20th century British composers including Granville Bantock (1868-1946), Henry Bishop (1786-1855), Arthur Bliss (1891-1975), John Stainer (1840-1901), Charles Villiers Stanford (1852-1924) and William Walton (1902-1983) are also represented.","Moldenhauer Collection--Correspondence, Photographs, Autographs and Albums, 1700-1973--Correspondence, Autographs and Autographed Musical Quotations--Massenet, Jules, 1842-1912",,Done,,Music--19th century--History and criticism|Musicians|Music--20th century--History and criticism,,,"The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the Music Library of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.
