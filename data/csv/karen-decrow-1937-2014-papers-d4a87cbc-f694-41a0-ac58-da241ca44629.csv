NOW was heavily involved in campaigning for ratification, though eventually only 35 of the required 38 states would ratify by the 1982 deadline (already extended once) and the amendment failed.

Karen DeCrow and Phyllis Schlafly debate the Equal Rights Amendment at Syracuse University. The debate was sponsored by the Women's Law Caucus of Syracuse University and the Greater Syracuse Chapter of NOW. DeCrow presents her argument first, then Schlafly speaks, and then there is time for rebuttal. Questions are taken from the audience. The attempted passing of the ERA was a decade-long process. After the amendment was approved in the United States Senate in 1972, it went to the states for ratification. NOW was heavily involved in campaigning for ratification, though eventually only 35 of the required 38 states would ratify by the 1982 deadline (already extended once) and the amendment failed. During this time, one voice that loudly dissented with the women’s liberation movement was Phyllis Schlafly with her STOP ERA campaign. DeCrow and Schlafly had completely opposite viewpoints, but enjoyed each other’s company. They toured the country together, debating the ERA over 80 times.",side 1|side 2|side 1|side 2|technical metadata file|spectrogram file|spectrogram file|asset back|asset front,,1,audiocassettes,e47cdcb0-1056-43f3-a5c3-00b643af0d6a,31/6/94,https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/e47cdcb0-1056-43f3-a5c3-00b643af0d6a?as=iiif,2023-02-20T16:39:15.645716,P0431_P0126_DeCrowAudio,P0431_P0126_decrowaudio_ingest.csv,,English,,University Archives,None,,2022-09-23T16:46:42.809962Z,,,,Level 1,"{'cycle': '2022', 'desc': 'DeCrow was a nationally recognized attorney, author, and advocate specializing in Constitutional law, gender and age discrimination, and civil liberties.
