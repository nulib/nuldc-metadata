The group provided a spiritual outlet and a space to connect at a predominately white university and engage in a Black cultural tradition. For the past 50 years, this music ministry still has a strong presence on campus and has impacted the greater Chicago area. In this documentary, the founders and early members tell the origin story. They also recall some of their favorite memories from their time in the choir.
