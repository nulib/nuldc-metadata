While the collection represents much of the European continent, it is particularly strong in manuscripts, correspondence and other materials by or related to German, French and English composers. Manuscripts by Ernest Bloch (1880-1959), Max Bruch (1838-1920), Max Keller (1770-1855) Ferdinand Praeger (1815-1891), a substantial collection of letters by Jules Massenet (1842-1912), and a sketch by Gustav Mahler (1860-1911) are among some of the most notable items. Other prominent composers and musicians represented in the Northwestern holdings include: John Blow (1648/9-1708), Benjamin Britten (1913-1976), Gustave Charpentier (1860-1956), Vincent d\u2019Indy (1851-1931), Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848), Edward Elgar (1857-1934), Charles Gounoud (1818-1893), Bohuslav Martin\u016f (1890-1959), Anton Rubenstein (1829-1894), Camille Saint-S\u00e4ens (1835-1921), and Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958). Additionally, a significant number of late 19th and early 20th century British composers including Granville Bantock (1868-1946), Henry Bishop (1786-1855), Arthur Bliss (1891-1975), John Stainer (1840-1901), Charles Villiers Stanford (1852-1924) and William Walton (1902-1983) are also represented."], "notes": []}, {"collection": {"description": "The Moldenhauer Collection is comprised of music manuscripts, sketches and quotations, correspondence, photographs, newspaper clippings, printed programs, manuscript texts and other materials which document composers and musicians active between 1683 and 1973.
