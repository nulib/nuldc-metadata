She served two terms, getting re-elected under a Majority Caucus platform in 1975, which emphasized support for all women, including women of color and non-heterosexual women, as well as advocating for repeal of anti-abortion laws. At this time, many NOW members felt that including race in its platform, as well as controversial issues such as gay rights and abortion, was distracting from the main equality message. Others, including DeCrow, felt that ignoring any existing inequalities within society, even within the membership of NOW, was against the ideals of an organization meant to promote equality. As president, DeCrow raised public awareness of NOW further by being the organization\u2019s first president to be invited to the White House. NOW under DeCrow\u2019s presidency led boycotts against states that chose not to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), helped defeat proposed limits on Title IX, held the first \u201cTake Back the Night\u201d march against violence against women, started multiple task forces, settled major employment discrimination lawsuits, and more."], "preservation_level": "Level 1", "keywords": [], "published": true, "related_url": [{"label": "Finding Aid", "url": "https://findingaids.library.northwestern.edu/repositories/6/resources/1166"}], "abstract": ["Karen DeCrow was a lawyer, writer, activist in the women's liberation movement of the 1970s, president of the National Organization for Women from 1974-1977, and a proponent of gender equality in all areas.

DeCrow's workshop focuses on fighting discrimination, and she discusses the glass ceiling and equal pay in terms of cases that she litigated. DeCrow was elected the fourth president of NOW in 1974. She served two terms, getting re-elected under a Majority Caucus platform in 1975, which emphasized support for all women, including women of color and non-heterosexual women, as well as advocating for repeal of anti-abortion laws. At this time, many NOW members felt that including race in its platform, as well as controversial issues such as gay rights and abortion, was distracting from the main equality message. Others, including DeCrow, felt that ignoring any existing inequalities within society, even within the membership of NOW, was against the ideals of an organization meant to promote equality. As president, DeCrow raised public awareness of NOW further by being the organization\u2019s first president to be invited to the White House. NOW under DeCrow\u2019s presidency led boycotts against states that chose not to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), helped defeat proposed limits on Title IX, held the first \u201cTake Back the Night\u201d march against violence against women, started multiple task forces, settled major employment discrimination lawsuits, and more."], "preservation_level": "Level 1", "keywords": [], "published": true, "related_url": [{"label": "Finding Aid", "url": "https://findingaids.library.northwestern.edu/repositories/6/resources/1166"}], "abstract": ["Karen DeCrow was a lawyer, writer, activist in the women's liberation movement of the 1970s, president of the National Organization for Women from 1974-1977, and a proponent of gender equality in all areas.
