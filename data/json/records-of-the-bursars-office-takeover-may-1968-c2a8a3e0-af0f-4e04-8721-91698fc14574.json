On April 22, 1968, members of Black student organizations, For Members Only (FMO) and African American Student Union (AASU), presented a list of demands to the Northwestern University administration regarding discriminatory campus policies and practices. When the demands were not met, on May 3, 1968, approximately 120 African American students occupied the Bursar\u2019s Office, Northwestern University\u2019s business office. The demonstration lasted for 38 hours when members of FMO and AASU and the administration ultimately reached a compromise on May 4, 1968. This effort successfully led to the \u201cMay 4th agreement\u201d in which the University promised enhanced support for African American students regarding admission, financial aid, housing, curriculum, and counseling, as well as an official statement by the administration admitting to the existence of institutional racism at the University.
